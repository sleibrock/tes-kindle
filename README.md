Elder Scrolls for Kindle
========================

Want to experience one of the better parts of Elder Scrolls? Now you can 
enjoy it from your Amazon® Kindle™!

# What is it?

A project aimed at converting Elder Scrolls books, notes, journals, religious 
texts and collections (lore) into the Kindle™ MOBI format.

# Just gimme the books

Okay, [here you go](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2tYExty6eSAZUx6U3F1VkZON2c).

# Required

* Python 3
* Beautiful Soup 4
* Requests
* [Kindlegen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211) binary
* (Testing) A Kindle™ 
* (Optional) Virtualenv

# Setup

It's as simple as cloning, installing packages, and running the script with 
Python 3.

But *please* don't do this as this will request so much information from the 
Imperial Library repeatedly. Instead, just download all the desired books 
from the [archive I uploaded above](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2tYExty6eSAZUx6U3F1VkZON2c).

# Credits

Credits go to the [Imperial Library](http://www.imperial-library.info)
for hosting user-submitted data from all Elder Scrolls games.
